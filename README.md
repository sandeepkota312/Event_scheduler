# Event_scheduler
Our event scheduler application provides a comprehensive solution for managing appointments and meetings. With user authentication in place, each user has their own calendar with time slots available for scheduling. Once a time slot is booked by one user, it becomes locked, ensuring that no other user can book the same slot at that specific time and day. Users also have the option to edit their meeting time if needed. To streamline the process, past dates are restricted from selection, preventing users from scheduling events in the past. Additionally, our application sends email notifications to both users involved in a meeting, ensuring they stay informed about their scheduled appointments. With these features, our event scheduler aims to simplify scheduling and enhance communication between users.
